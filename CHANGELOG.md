## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added

#### Core ML Components
- **TCN Encoder** — Temporal Convolutional Network built from scratch in PyTorch.
  Four dilated causal convolution blocks (dilations `[1, 2, 4, 8]`) with residual
  connections and LayerNorm. Trained with NT-Xent contrastive loss on synthetic
  interaction data.
- **Custom SLM** — ~6.3M parameter transformer built entirely from first principles
  (no HuggingFace). Includes:
  - Word-level tokenizer with special tokens and vocabulary building
  - Token embeddings with sinusoidal positional encoding
  - Multi-head self-attention with KV caching for inference
  - Novel cross-attention conditioning to AdaptationVector + UserStateEmbedding
  - Pre-LN transformer blocks (4 layers, 256 d_model, 4 heads)
  - Weight-tied output projection
  - Top-k / top-p / repetition-penalty sampling
  - INT8 dynamic quantization for edge deployment
- **Contextual Thompson Sampling Bandit** — Two-arm contextual bandit with
  Bayesian logistic regression posteriors, Laplace approximation refitted via
  Newton-Raphson MAP estimation, and Beta-Bernoulli cold-start fallback.
- **Three-Timescale User Model** — Instant state, session profile (EMA α=0.3),
  and long-term profile (EMA α=0.1) with Welford's online algorithm for
  running feature statistics.

#### Behavioural Perception
- **Interaction Monitor** — Real-time keystroke event processing with per-user
  buffers, typing burst detection (500ms pause threshold), and composition metrics.
- **32-Dimensional Feature Vector** — Four groups of 8 features covering keystroke
  dynamics, message content, session dynamics, and deviation from baseline.
- **Linguistic Analyzer** — Flesch-Kincaid grade, type-token ratio, formality
  scoring (52 contractions + 54 slang markers), syllable counting, and
  ~365-word sentiment lexicon with negation handling — all implemented from
  scratch with no external NLP libraries.

#### Adaptation Layer
- **Four Adaptation Dimensions** — CognitiveLoad, StyleMirror (4-dim formality/
  verbosity/emotionality/directness), EmotionalTone, and Accessibility adapters.
- **AdaptationVector** — 8-dimensional vector serializable to/from tensors for
  model conditioning.

#### Cloud Integration
- **Async Anthropic Client** — Built with httpx, supports retry with exponential
  backoff, token usage tracking, and graceful fallback.
- **Dynamic Prompt Builder** — Translates AdaptationVector to natural-language
  system prompt instructions.
- **Response Post-Processor** — Enforces length limits and vocabulary
  simplification for accessibility.

#### Persistence
- **Async SQLite Stores** — User models and interaction diary use `aiosqlite`
  for non-blocking I/O.
- **Privacy-Safe Diary** — Logs only embeddings, scalar metrics, TF-IDF topic
  keywords, and adaptation parameters — never raw user text.
- **TF-IDF Topic Extraction** — 175 stopwords, 60 pre-computed IDF scores with
  rare-term fallback.

#### Web Application
- **FastAPI Backend** — Async application factory with lifespan management,
  WebSocket handler for real-time interaction, and REST API.
- **Dark-Theme Frontend** — Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (no build step) with:
  - KeystrokeMonitor capturing inter-key intervals, bursts, and composition time
  - Canvas-based 2D embedding visualization with fading trail
  - Animated gauge bars for all adaptation dimensions
  - Collapsible diary panel
  - WebSocket client with exponential backoff reconnection

#### Privacy & Security
- **10 PII Regex Patterns** — Email, phone (US/UK/intl), SSN, credit card, IP
  address, physical address, DOB, URL.
- **Fernet Encryption** — Symmetric encryption for user model embeddings at rest
  with environment-based key management.
- **Privacy Auditor** — Async database scanner that detects raw-text leaks in
  SQLite tables.
- **Topic Sensitivity Detector** — 12 regex patterns across 8 categories
  (mental health, credentials, abuse, financial, medical, relationship, legal,
  employment) with severity scoring for privacy-override routing.

#### Edge Feasibility
- **Memory Profiler** — `tracemalloc`-based peak memory measurement, FP32 vs
  INT8 size comparison, parameter counting.
- **Latency Benchmark** — P50/P95/P99 percentiles with warmup iterations and
  FP32 vs INT8 speedup comparison.
- **Device Feasibility Matrix** — Assessments against Kirin 9000, Kirin A2, and
  Smart Hanhan with configurable memory budgets.
- **Markdown Report Generation** — For use in presentation materials.

#### Testing
- **80+ Unit Tests** — Across TCN, SLM, bandit, user model, and pipeline components.
- **Security Test Suite** — Dedicated tests for PII sanitization, encryption
  round-trips, topic sensitivity, input validation, and DoS resistance.
- **Property-Based Tests** — Shape invariants, bandit convergence, adaptation
  vector bounds.
- **Integration Tests** — End-to-end pipeline flow with privacy guarantee checks.
- **Shared Fixtures** — `conftest.py` with 7 reusable fixtures including async
  temporary diary store.

#### Documentation
- **README.md** — Portfolio-grade project overview with box-drawn architecture
  diagrams, layer-by-layer descriptions, and edge feasibility tables.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — ~750-line research-paper-style design document covering
  system overview, data flow, the 32-dim feature vector, TCN architecture math,
  three-timescale user model, adaptation dimensions, Thompson sampling
  Bayesian formulation, cross-attention conditioning novelty, privacy
  architecture, and design trade-offs.
- **DEMO_SCRIPT.md** — Operational 4-phase demo playbook with pre-flight
  checklist, exact dialogue, recovery procedures, and timing budget.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — Development workflow, coding standards, and
  contribution process.
- **SECURITY.md** — Security policy, threat model, audit report, and mitigations.

#### Tooling & Infrastructure
- **Poetry** dependency management with 4 dependency groups (main, dev, security, docs).
- **Ruff** linting and formatting with security lints (`S`, `B`, `PTH`).
- **Mypy** type checking with per-module overrides.
- **Pytest** with asyncio support, coverage, parallel execution (xdist), and markers.
- **Pre-commit hooks** for automated quality checks.
- **GitHub Actions CI** with matrix testing across Python 3.10/3.11/3.12 on
  Ubuntu and macOS.
- **Security workflows** running Bandit, pip-audit, Safety, and CodeQL.
- **Dependabot** for weekly dependency updates grouped by ecosystem.
- **Issue and PR templates** for GitHub.
- **Makefile** with 25+ self-documenting targets and colored output.
- **Setup scripts** (`scripts/setup.sh`, `scripts/run_demo.sh`,
  `scripts/generate_encryption_key.py`).

### Security
- Formal security audit conducted — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **CORS** restricted to configurable origins; wildcard only permitted behind
  an explicit opt-in environment variable.
- **Rate limiting** on API (60 req/min per IP) and WebSocket (600 msg/min per
  user) endpoints.
- **Security headers middleware** — X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options,
  Content-Security-Policy, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy.
- **Request size limiting** — 1 MB maximum on REST requests.
- **WebSocket limits** — 64 KB max message size, 1000 messages per session,
  1 hour maximum session duration.
- **Input validation** — User IDs restricted to `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$`;
  pagination params bounded.
- **torch.load** with `weights_only=True` for safer deserialization.
- **yaml.safe_load** for all configuration loading.
- **Exception handlers** sanitise error responses — no stack traces or
  internal paths exposed.
- **API key redaction** in logs (never logs full key, only prefix/suffix).
- **Default bind** to loopback only (`127.0.0.1`) — public bind requires
  explicit `I3_HOST` override.

### Infrastructure Choices
- Python 3.10+ required (uses modern typing syntax).
- PyTorch 2.0+ for eager mode and native quantization.
- FastAPI 0.110+ with Starlette middleware.
- Pydantic 2.6+ for configuration validation.
- aiosqlite 0.20+ for async database access.
- cryptography 42+ for Fernet symmetric encryption.
